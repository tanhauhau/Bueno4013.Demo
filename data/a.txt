A (plural As, A's, as, a's) is the first letter and the first vowel in the ISO basic Latin alphabet. It is similar to the Ancient Greek letter alpha, from which it derives. The upper-case version consists of the two slanting sides of a triangle, crossed in the middle by a horizontal bar. The lower-case version can be written in two forms: the double-storey a and single-storey a. The latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it, especially fonts intended to be read by children. It is also found in italic type.
The earliest certain ancestor of "A" is aleph (also written 'aleph), the first letter of the Phoenician alphabet (which consisted entirely of consonants; for that reason, it is also called an abjad to distinguish it from a true alphabet). In turn, the ancestor of aleph may have been a pictogram of an ox head in proto-Sinaitic script influenced by Egyptian hieroglyphs, styled as a triangular head with two horns extended.
