B or b (pronounced bee) is the 2nd letter in the ISO basic Latin alphabet. It represents the voiced bilabial stop in many languages, including English. In some other languages, it is used to represent other bilabial consonants.
Old English was originally written in runes, whose equivalent letter was beorc , meaning "birch". Beorc dates to at least the 2nd-century Elder Futhark, which is now thought to have derived from the Old Italic alphabets (B) either directly or via Latin (B).

The uncial (B) and half-uncial (b) introduced by the Gregorian and Irish missions gradually developed into the Insular scripts' (b). These Old English Latin alphabets supplanted the earlier runes, whose use was fully banned under King Canute in the early 11th century. The Norman Conquest popularized the Carolingian half-uncial forms which latter developed into blackletter ( b ). Around 1300, letter case was increasingly distinguished, with upper- and lower-case B taking separate meanings. Following the advent of printing in the 15th century, Germany and Scandinavia continued to use forms of blackletter (particularly Fraktur), while England eventually adopted the humanist and antiqua scripts developed in Renaissance Italy from a combination of Roman inscriptions and Carolingian texts. The present forms of the English cursive B were developed by the 17th century.

The Roman (B) derived from the Greek capital beta (B) via its Etruscan and Cumaean variants. The Greek letter was an adaptation of the Phoenician letter bet. The Egyptian hieroglyph for the consonant /b/ had been an image of a foot and calf, but bet (Phoenician for "house") was a modified form of a Proto-Sinaitic glyph ( Bet ) probably adapted from the separate hieroglyph Pr meaning "house".[5][n 1] The Hebrew letter beth is a separate development of the Phoenician letter.
